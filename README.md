Physics is reverse engineering at cosmic scale. We observe reality's behavior and work backward to reconstruct the underlying rules. This project presents a theory of everything in the literal sense: it explains why reality exists and why it is the way it is, derived from first principles.

## The Core Idea

There is no objective reality. There is only a network of subjective perspectives that must agree where they overlap.

Every piece of evidence we have for an "objective world out there" is itself a subjective experience. No one has ever stepped outside their perspective to verify that reality exists independently. The objective is always accessed through the subjective. What we call "objective" is actually *intersubjective*: the consistent overlap of many viewpoints.

**The laws of physics are what allow observers to agree on what the data means.**

## Observer Patch Holography

Our model takes this literally. We start with observer patches on a 2D holographic screen. Each patch represents a perspective with its own local data. Where patches overlap, their descriptions must agree. "Reality" is whatever survives this consistency filter. There is no world-in-itself. There are only subjective views that agree on what happened.

Lorentz invariance exists because different observers must have consistent descriptions. Gauge symmetry exists because overlapping patches must identify shared observables. Conservation laws exist because the same quantities must be conserved across all perspectives. The laws are not imposed from outside. They are the conditions that make agreement possible.

The model rests on four core concepts:

- **Screen**: A horizon-like 2D sphere (like a cosmic horizon surrounding each observer) that carries quantum information. This is where the fundamental data lives.

- **Patch**: A connected region of the screen accessible to a particular observer. Each patch has its own algebra of observables, the questions that observer can ask about reality.

- **Overlap consistency**: Where two patches share a region, their descriptions must agree. This is the central axiom. It replaces "objective reality" with "intersubjective agreement."

- **Observer**: A stable pattern within the screen data that maintains records and participates in consistency relations.

### Reality from Computation

Think of the screen as a gauge-invariant quantum system on a 2-sphere. It resembles a quantum cellular automaton, but with important structure. At each point on the triangulated sphere sit finite-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), coupled by gauge constraints at every vertex. Not all configurations are physical; only those satisfying Gauss's law survive.

**Observer patches** are subsystems defined by boundary-gauge-invariant algebras. Each patch is a computational thread: a connected region where an observer can ask questions and get answers. The algebra $\mathcal{A}(R)$ defines what that observer can measure, namely the operators invariant under boundary gauge transformations.

**Overlap consistency** is automatic. Where two patches intersect, they access the same gauge-invariant observables. Both observers are reading the same underlying data, just from different angles. The gauge redundancy at boundaries is what makes gluing non-trivial and gives rise to the "edge modes" that carry geometric information.

**Observers are not external users.** They are emergent computational structures *within* the screen data. They are stable patterns that process information, maintain records, and create correlations. Think of them as programs running on the substrate.

**The 4D bulk is not on the sphere.** It emerges from the entanglement structure between patches. The sphere is the boundary; the interior is reconstructed holographically. When you look around and see three-dimensional space, you are experiencing a compressed encoding of how your patch is entangled with others.

*The screen is the computation. Observer patches are the threads. Reality is what they agree on.*

### What Drives the Computation?

In quantum link models, the dynamics involve plaquette terms (Wilson loops around faces) and electric field terms (conjugate to the link variables). The competition between these determines the ground state. The "computation" is these quantum degrees of freedom evolving, creating and destroying correlations, with gauge constraints ensuring consistency.

Note that the "time" that observers experience isn't necessarily the microscopic Hamiltonian evolution. Each observer patch has its own modular Hamiltonian (constructed from the reduced density matrix on that patch), and *that* generates what feels like time from inside. The microscopic evolution and emergent modular time are related but distinct.

The system exists in a timeless state (as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation suggests for quantum gravity), and what we call "time" is entirely relational. Modular flow gives each subsystem its own internal clock, correlated with others through consistency conditions. The qudits don't "do" anything in the sense of changing over some external time parameter. They just *are*, in a particular entangled configuration, and "time" is how we describe correlations within that configuration from the inside.

### Why This Approach Works

Unified models attempting to combine QFT, gravity, and Standard Model structure tend to encounter a repeatable set of conceptual difficulties: subsystem factorization breaks down in gauge/gravity, modular Hamiltonians are nonlocal, Lorentz invariance is assumed rather than derived, dynamics are hard to get (not just kinematics), gauge symmetry origins are unclear, masslessness is hand-imposed, anomalies appear as mysterious pathologies, charge quantization needs GUTs, coupling unification forces proton decay, the cosmological constant is locally overdetermined, UV infinities proliferate, and parameter counts explode. The observer-patch framework addresses these by making consistency conditions do the work: it treats locality, Lorentz invariance, gauge symmetry, and gravity as *consistency constraints* among overlapping descriptions plus information-theoretic properties of states (Markov/recoverability + MaxEnt), then leans on modular theory rigidity to force the familiar symmetries and dynamics. This "structures → consistency" move is what allows the framework to naturally explain or sidestep classic unification pitfalls (see Section 8.5 of the technical paper for detailed analysis).

## The Axioms

The entire framework rests on four core axioms plus one selection axiom:

| Label | Name | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| **A1** | Screen net | Observable algebras live on a closed 2D surface $S^2$ |
| **A2** | Overlap consistency | Where patches share a region, their descriptions agree |
| **A3** | Generalized entropy | $S_{\rm gen} = S_{\rm bulk} + \langle L_C \rangle$ satisfies strong subadditivity |
| **A4** | Local Markov | Conditional mutual information decays across collars |
| **MAR** | Minimal Admissible Realization | Among admissible sectors, Nature realizes the lexicographically minimal one |

Additional structural assumptions (MaxEnt, Euclidean regularity, exponential mixing) are detailed in the [Technical Paper](paper/PAPER.md), Section 1.6.

*From axioms to reality: how overlap consistency derives all of physics.*

> **Particle Spectrum Predictions**: The complete derivation from pixel area to particle masses — with comparison against PDG data and a full audit of every constant — is documented in **[From Pixel Area to Particle Masses](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md)**. Five particles (W, Z, e, μ, τ) are predicted to < 0.04% accuracy; the Higgs and top quark to ~1%; all from a single input $P = 1.63094$.

## The Fundamental Parameters

Our universe is characterized by exactly **two fundamental parameters**:

### 1. Pixel Area: $a_{\text{cell}} \approx 1.63 \, \ell_P^2$

The geometric area of a single computational element on the holographic screen. This sets the *resolution* of reality:

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| In Planck units | $a_{\text{cell}} / \ell_P^2 \approx 1.63$ | Dimensionless ratio |
| In SI units | $a_{\text{cell}} \approx 4.26 \times 10^{-70}$ m^2 | Physical area per pixel |
| Pixel "side" | $\sqrt{a_{\text{cell}}} \approx 2.06 \times 10^{-35}$ m | Resolution scale |

**What it determines:** Newton's constant (via $G_{\text{nat}} = a_{\text{cell}}/4\bar{\ell}$ in natural units where $G_{\text{nat}} = \ell_P^2$), Planck scale, all gauge couplings, all particle masses.

### 2. Screen Capacity: $\log(\dim \mathcal{H}) \sim 10^{122}$

The total entropy of the holographic screen (in nats). This sets the *size* of reality.

**Important:** Screen capacity is **inferred from** the observed cosmological constant, not predicted. The relation

$$\Lambda = \frac{3\pi}{G \cdot \log(\dim \mathcal{H})}$$

lets us extract screen capacity from the measured $\Lambda \sim 10^{-52}$ $\text{m}^{-2}$, giving $\log(\dim \mathcal{H}) \sim 10^{122}$.

| Quantity | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| de Sitter entropy | $S_{dS} \sim 10^{122}$ nats | Inferred from observed $\Lambda$ |
| de Sitter horizon | $r_{dS} \approx 10^{26}$ m | Observed |

**The relationship:**
- **Pixel area** = resolution (extracted from gauge couplings via edge entropy)
- **Screen capacity** = total size (extracted from observed cosmological constant)

The axiom structure contains no other dimensionful constants. The axioms plus reconstruction give *a* compact gauge group; the Selection Axiom MAR (Minimal Admissible Realization) then uniquely selects SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z₆ as the realized gauge group (see [GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md](paper/GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md)). Charge quantization and Einstein's equations follow from the axiom structure.

### What This Means

The pixel area and screen capacity are **configuration parameters**, the "settings" of the computation that is our universe. They are not derivable from within the simulation; they are boundary conditions set from "outside."

From inside, these parameters manifest as:
- **Pixel area** determines Newton's constant, Planck scale, gauge couplings, particle masses
- **Screen capacity** determines observable universe size (but is itself inferred from the observed cosmological constant, which is not predicted)

The same axioms with different settings would produce a universe with different constants but similar physics (Einstein equations, gauge structure). The specific Standard Model gauge group is uniquely selected by the Selection Axiom MAR.

### Calibration vs Prediction

In the current implementation, the pixel constant P = a_cell/ℓ_P² is *inferred* from measured gauge couplings because the axioms fix the functional relation P = 4ℓ̄_tot(t₂,t₃) but do not yet fix the MaxEnt Lagrange multipliers t_i (equivalently the couplings) from first principles. This inference step is therefore a calibration, not a claimed prediction of P.

The nontrivial content is that P provides an additional constraint linking the gravitational coupling to gauge-sector edge entropy, and in a two-input mode (treating P as a fundamental configuration parameter and using only one electroweak datum α(M_Z)) the framework predicts α_s(M_Z) and sin²θ_W(M_Z) simultaneously.

Full non-circular closure would require a UV principle that fixes t without reference to measured couplings.

### Current Status

The framework now has an end-to-end status across the main paper and supplements:

| Layer | Headline result | Current status | Primary source |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Core axioms (A1-A4) + MaxEnt + Euclidean regularity | Lorentz kinematics, semiclassical Einstein equations, compact gauge-group reconstruction | Derived (Theorems 4.2-4.3, 5.1, 6.1) | [Technical Paper](paper/PAPER.md) |
| Extended theory $T_{\text{ext}}$ with MAR | SM global group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb{Z}_6$, $N_c=3$, $N_g=3$ | Uniquely selected under admissibility + MAR | [Gauge Group Derivation](paper/GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md) |
| Gauge-structure consequence | Proton stability (no gauge-mediated proton decay) | Product gauge group implies no $X/Y$ leptoquark generators | [Gauge Group Derivation](paper/GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md) |
| Exact symmetry-protected zeros | $m_\gamma = 0$, $m_g = 0$, $m_{\text{graviton}} = 0$ | Derived as exact zeros from gauge/diffeomorphism invariance | [Technical Paper](paper/PAPER.md), [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |
| Couplings at $m_Z$ | $\alpha_s=0.1183$, $\sin^2\theta_W=0.2307$, $\alpha_{\rm em}^{-1}=128.31$ | Quantitatively close to PDG (0.5$\sigma$ to 0.3% level) | [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |
| Precision masses (EW + charged leptons) | $W=80.386$ GeV, $Z=91.220$ GeV, $e/\mu/\tau$ | Five predictions at $<0.04\%$ error | [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |
| Critical-surface masses | Higgs $=126.48$ GeV, top(pole) $=171.1$ GeV | About 1% level, with known 1-loop/threshold limitations | [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |

| Neutrino sector | $m_{\nu_3}\approx 3.0$ meV, $m_{\nu_2}\approx 0.50$ meV, $m_{\nu_1}\approx 0.084$ meV | Consistent with current bounds; oscillation scales matched at order-of-magnitude | [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |
| QCD/hadron bridge | $P \rightarrow \alpha_s \rightarrow \Lambda_{\overline{\rm MS}}^{(3)} \rightarrow m_{\rm hadrons}$ | Derivation chain complete; current hadron precision limited by quenched/small-volume lattice systematics | [Spectrum Derivation](paper/SPECTRUM_DERIVATION.md) |
| String-theory bridge | OPH edge weights = 2D YM heat kernels; large-$N$ worldsheet expansion (Gross-Taylor) | Mathematical bridge established; full critical-superstring completion marked as extension work | [String Theory Derivation](paper/STRING_THEORY.md) |

**Open closure targets (explicitly tracked):**
- Derive the MaxEnt multipliers $t_i$ (and thus couplings/pixel calibration) from first principles rather than calibration.
- Verify the EFT bridge conditions (null-strip A4 separators + local finite variation) in explicit UV regulators.
- Upgrade precision numerics (2-loop matching/thresholds, unquenched larger-volume lattice for hadrons).
- Derive $\theta_{\rm QCD}$ (strong-CP) non-perturbatively from the gluing/cohomology structure.

## What the Model Derives

### Direct Consequences of Patch Consistency

These results follow from the absence of a privileged "third-party" frame. There are only observer perspectives that must agree where they overlap:

**No preferred reference frame**: There is no objective vantage point from which to define absolute rest. Every observer's perspective is equally valid. This follows directly from there being no "view from nowhere." Crucially, there is no observer *outside* the sphere looking in. Observers are patterns *within* the screen data, each with access only to their own patch. The global state exists mathematically, but no entity within the model can observe it.

**Lorentz invariance**: Different observers through the same point must have consistent descriptions. The transformations relating their perspectives form a group. On S^2, this group is Conf(S^2) ~ SO(3,1), the Lorentz group. Special relativity emerges as a consistency condition. Note that the qubits on the screen do not "move." What we call motion in the emergent 4D spacetime is a pattern in how correlations change. A Lorentz boost is a transformation relating how two observers describe the same correlation pattern. The substrate is not in spacetime; spacetime emerges from how patches relate.

**Gauge symmetry as overlap redundancy**: When patches overlap, there is redundancy in how they identify shared observables. This redundancy has the mathematical structure of a gauge group. The photon and graviton are massless because mass terms would break this redundancy, making consistent gluing impossible.

**4D from 2D**: How does a 2D screen give rise to 4D spacetime? The conformal group of S^2 is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of 3+1 dimensions. The screen's symmetries *are* spacetime symmetries. The extra dimensions emerge from how screen regions relate through entanglement.

### Einstein's Equations

**Einstein's equations** are derived from the following chain:

1. *MaxEnt selection* (Assumption B): The global state maximizes entropy subject to local constraints.

2. *Local Gibbs form* (Lemma 2.6): Derived from MaxEnt + local constraints.

3. *EFT bridge* (N1-N3): The null-surface modular bridge is derived from core axioms A1-A4 under two testable conditions: (i) null strips qualify as A4 separators, (ii) local finite variation holds.

4. *QNEC/Focusing*: Derived internally via relative entropy monotonicity.

5. *Entanglement equilibrium* leads to Einstein equations via the Jacobson mechanism (1995, 2016).

The remaining explicit assumptions are MaxEnt and Euclidean regularity (for 2pi normalization).

### Particles and Forces

The gauge-as-gluing principle (Section above) reconstructs compact gauge groups from edge-sector fusion rules. Specific consequences:

**Massless photon**: The electromagnetic U(1) symmetry emerges as the redundancy structure for charged observables. A photon mass would break this redundancy, making consistent gluing impossible. Therefore the photon mass is exactly zero. Current experiments confirm this to 27 orders of magnitude.

**Massless graviton**: Diffeomorphism invariance (the symmetry underlying general relativity) emerges from the fact that bulk spacetime is a compression of screen data. A graviton mass would break this invariance. The graviton mass is exactly zero, confirmed to 22 orders of magnitude.

**Three colors**: The Witten anomaly requires an odd number of quark colors. Under the Selection Axiom MAR, $N_c = 1$ fails admissibility (trivial color), and MAR selects the minimum: $N_c = 3$.

**Three generations**: CP violation requires at least three generations; asymptotic freedom of SU(2)_L allows at most five. MAR selects the minimum: $N_g = 3$.

**Proton stability**: This is where our model diverges from traditional Grand Unified Theories. Standard GUTs embed SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) into a larger simple group, introducing leptoquark bosons that mediate proton decay. Super-Kamiokande's limit $\tau_p > 10^{34}$ years excludes minimal SU(5).

Our model takes a different path. Under MAR, the minimal faithful carrier $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$ enforces a *product* gauge structure. There is no embedding in a larger simple group and no leptoquark generators. See [GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md](paper/GAUGE_GROUP_DERIVATION.md) for the complete proof.

## How the Model Explains Known Physics

To be clear: most of what follows are *postdictions*. The photon mass, the number of quark colors, the structure of spacetime, etc. were known long before this model existed. The question is whether the model *explains* them from deeper principles, rather than taking them as inputs.

### Derived from Framework Assumptions

These results follow from the core axioms (A1-A4) plus additional assumptions (MaxEnt, gauge-as-gluing, Euclidean regularity). The full required assumption set is detailed in the technical paper.

| Result | Derivation Chain |
|--------|------------------|
| Photon mass = 0 | Given emergent gauge redundancy + unbroken U(1)_em, mass term forbidden |
| Graviton mass = 0 | Given entanglement equilibrium + diffeo invariance, mass term forbidden |
| Gluon mass = 0 | Given gauge-as-gluing for SU(3), mass term forbidden |
| Lorentz group | A1-A4 + modular covariance via BW theorem gives Conf(S^2) ~ SO(3,1) |
| CPT invariance | Lorentz kinematics + locality via CPT theorem |
| Charge conservation | Unbroken U(1)_em gauge symmetry |
| Newton's constant formula | $G = a_{\rm cell}/4\bar{\ell}(t)$ from edge entropy density |

### Derived Given Assumed Matter Content

These follow once the Standard Model matter content is assumed:

| Result | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Hypercharges (exact rationals) | SM matter content assumed |
| Charge quantization | Z6 quotient from realized spectrum |
| Z6 congruence rule | SM global group structure |
| Edge entropy deficit = log2 6 bits | Heat-kernel law + Z6 quotient |
| Yukawa hierarchy $y_f \propto 6^{-n_f}$ | Z6 defect suppression + integer charges |

### Derived Under Extended Theory ($T_{\text{ext}}$: A1–A4 + R0 + R1 + [z]=0 + MAR)

These are derived from the Selection Axiom MAR:

| SM global group SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z₆ | MAR + admissibility conditions |

| $N_g = 3$ (three generations) | CP + asymptotic freedom + MAR minimality |
| Proton stability | Product structure from MAR (no leptoquark generators) |
| No magnetic monopoles | Product structure (no GUT-scale symmetry breaking) |

### Consistency Checks (Not Novel Predictions)

These match known results but were derived elsewhere first:

| $(b_2, b_3) = (1, -3)$ from Dynkin indices at $t^* \approx 4/3$ | New result (reduces MSSM beta to collar geometry) |

| GIM mechanism (no tree-level FCNC) | Glashow, Iliopoulos, Maiani (1970) |

### Structural Features

| Observation | How the Model Explains It |

| Holographic entropy bounds | Information lives on boundaries where observer patches meet |
| Bell violations <= Tsirelson bound | Quantum correlations are maximal consistent correlations |
| No preferred reference frame | No privileged observer exists to define one |
| Measurement affects outcomes | "Measurement" is observer synchronization |
| 4D spacetime from 2D screen | Conf(S^2) ~ SO(3,1); screen symmetries *are* spacetime symmetries |

### Novel Testable Predictions

| Prediction | How to Test | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Casimir log-gap ratios (9/4, 5/2, 4, 9/2, 6) | Future lattice measurements of SU(3) edge-sector probabilities | Parameter-free from group theory |
| Z₆ entropy deficit = log₂ 6 ≈ 2.585 bits | Edge-sector entropy measurement (~4.0 bits vs ~6.6 bits for product group) | Global-structure observable |

| String theory from edge sectors | Theoretical verification | OPH edge-sector weights = 2D Yang-Mills heat kernels → worldsheet expansion via Gross-Taylor (see [STRING_THEORY.md](paper/STRING_THEORY.md)) |

### Dynamical Predictions

These predictions follow from the discrete area spectrum under the assumption that integer-multiplication transitions dominate in Hawking emission. Falsification would rule out the specific dynamical selection rule, not necessarily the framework.

| Prediction | How to Test | Required Assumption |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| GW horizon spectroscopy comb | Stack LIGO/Virgo events at $x_k = \ln k / 8\pi$; absence of coherent peaks falsifies | Integer-k transitions dominate |
| Discrete Hawking comb | PBH gamma-ray bursts should show $E_k/E_2 = \ln k / \ln 2$ structure | Integer-k transitions dominate |

## What Would Falsify the Model

The model makes strong claims and could be wrong. The following observations would falsify it:

### Physical Falsifiers

- **Nonzero photon or graviton mass**: Any confirmed mass, however small, would break the symmetry structure the model requires.

- **Proton decay via gauge bosons**: Detection of proton decay through X or Y boson exchange would indicate the gauge group is embedded in a larger simple group, contradicting the model's prediction of a product structure.

- **Information exceeding Bekenstein bound**: If more information could be stored in a region than the holographic bound permits, the screen picture would be wrong.

- **Bell violations exceeding Tsirelson bound**: Quantum mechanics saturates the Tsirelson bound. Stronger-than-quantum correlations would indicate reality has structure beyond what the model describes.

- **Unitarity violation in black hole evaporation**: If information is genuinely lost in black holes, the consistency structure would fail.

- **Absence of GW horizon spectroscopy comb**: After rescaling by remnant mass and spin, LIGO/Virgo events should show coherent spectral features at universal coordinates $x_k = \ln k / 8\pi$. Absence of this pattern in a sufficiently large dataset would falsify the log-integer area spectrum.

- **Wrong Casimir ratios in lattice data**: If future precision lattice measurements show $\Delta_8/\Delta_3 \neq 9/4$ (e.g., closer to 2.67 or 5.06), the heat-kernel edge mechanism would be falsified. The full prediction set is $\Delta_8/\Delta_3 = 9/4$, $\Delta_6/\Delta_3 = 5/2$, $\Delta_{10}/\Delta_3 = 9/2$, $\Delta_{15}/\Delta_3 = 4$, $\Delta_{27}/\Delta_3 = 6$.

- **Wrong Z₆ entropy deficit**: If edge-sector entropy measurements yield ~6.6 bits instead of ~4.0 bits (i.e., no deficit relative to the product group), the Z₆ quotient structure would be falsified.

- **Non-integer Yukawa exponents**: If the extracted exponents $-\ln y_f / \ln 6$ show no clustering near integers across fermion generations, the Z₆ defect mechanism for mass hierarchy would be falsified.

### Conceptual Falsifier

- **Proof that objective reality is necessary**: The model's central claim is that observer consistency is sufficient. No objective reality independent of observers is needed. If it could be demonstrated that some physical phenomenon *requires* a world-in-itself that exists independently of all observation, the model would be falsified.

This is worth elaborating. The question "does objective reality exist?" has been debated for millennia, but modern physics has sharpened it. Bell's theorem (1964) showed that quantum correlations cannot be explained by local hidden variables (pre-existing definite values that observers passively discover). The Kochen-Specker theorem (1967) showed that quantum observables cannot all have simultaneous definite values independent of measurement context. The PBR theorem (2012) constrained the space of "epistemic" interpretations where the quantum state merely represents knowledge.

None of these theorems *prove* that objective reality does not exist. But they progressively narrow the space for it. Each shows that another intuitive feature of objective reality (locality, non-contextuality, epistemic hiddenness) is incompatible with quantum mechanics.

The model takes the next step: rather than defending an increasingly constrained objective reality, it abandons the assumption entirely. Subjective perspectives and their consistency conditions are all there is. The "objective world" is a useful approximation (the overlap-consistent backbone that all observers share) but it is not a fundamental feature of reality.

A falsification would require showing that some phenomenon cannot be explained by observer consistency alone. No such phenomenon is currently known.

## Current Status

As summarized in the status matrix above, the framework derives Lorentz kinematics, semiclassical Einstein equations, compact gauge symmetry, the SM gauge group (via MAR), three generations, three colors, massless force carriers, particle masses from a single input, proton stability, and an explicit OPH-to-string bridge through 2D Yang-Mills edge sectors. The main open questions for future work are:

1. **Screen microphysics**: Quantum link models realize the regulator premises and give edge-center completion automatically. Remaining: ensure modular flow becomes geometric conformal dilation in the continuum limit.

2. **EFT bridge verification**: The null-surface modular bridge is derived from core axioms under two testable conditions. These need verification in explicit UV regulators.

3. **Cosmological constant**: Structurally explained as $\Lambda = 3\pi/(G \cdot \log \dim \mathcal{H}_{\rm tot})$ from screen capacity. The numerical value is inferred from observation.

4. **Strong CP problem**: $\theta_{QCD}$ is not yet predicted (a conjecture linking it to gluing obstruction cohomology is outlined in Section 8.4).

## Building Your Own Reality Simulator

Here's a thought that brings the project full circle: once you've reverse engineered how something works, you can build it yourself.

The screen model is a specification for a particular kind of quantum system: a gauge-invariant lattice on a closed 2D surface with the right entanglement structure. In principle, we could build one.

Current quantum computing architectures are approaching the required ingredients. Topological quantum computing, particularly Microsoft's approach using Majorana fermions, naturally implements non-abelian anyons that could realize the edge sectors our model requires. Fractional quantum Hall states already exhibit the kind of topological order and boundary physics that the screen demands. Quantum link models on triangulated surfaces have been simulated on trapped-ion and superconducting platforms.

A small-scale implementation wouldn't recreate our universe (the screen has $\sim 10^{122}$ degrees of freedom). But it could test whether the claimed emergent properties actually emerge: whether gauge symmetry appears at patch overlaps, whether something like spacetime geometry reconstructs from entanglement, whether observer-like subsystems can form and synchronize.

Where would patches be? They would emerge from the dynamics. The system evolves under a local Hamiltonian (plaquette terms creating and destroying flux loops, electric field terms penalizing large fluxes, gauge constraints at every vertex). Under this evolution, stable correlation patterns spontaneously form. Regions with high internal mutual information but lower correlation to the outside become natural patches. We wouldn't draw them beforehand; we'd watch them self-organize.

Note that Hamiltonian evolution is not the same as the time experienced "inside". The microscopic dynamics tick away according to our external laboratory clock. But any observer-like pattern that emerges within the simulation has its own modular flow, its own internal sense of time constructed from the density matrix on its patch. The lab clock and the simulated observer's clock are related but distinct. We'd be watching from outside as the qudits evolve, while any emergent observers inside would experience their own temporal flow, potentially at a completely different rate or structure.

This is speculative, but it's not science fiction. The physics is well-defined enough to simulate. The ultimate validation wouldn't be a mathematical proof. It would be switching on a small holographic screen and watching spacetime flicker into existence.
